                    <h2>HISTORY</h2>

                    <h3>Pre 1961</h3><br>
                    <p>The Goa Police as an independent organisation was born in April 1946 with the establishment of Policia do
                        Estado da India (PEI) Police of India, through a decree of the Portuguese regime which ruled Goa until 1961.
                        Until then, all policing functions including the maintenance of law and order were being carried out by the
                        Portuguese military.<br><br>
            
            
            
                        The PEI was responsible for carrying out the functions of vigilance and maintenance of general order and
                        comprised the following branches: public security, judicial police, internal and external traffic police,
                        administrative & municipal police and civil identifications. Two years later, appropriate rules governing
                        the police were framed on the lines of the legislation then prevailing in Portugal.<br><br>
            
            
                        In the two-year period of the rules being framed,the PEI functioned under the regulations of O Corpo de
                        Policia e Fiscalizacao da India (CPFI) - The Corps of Police and Inspection Services of India that had been
                        set up in 1924 to function as the policing arm of the military. The police services had been placed under
                        the direct supervision of the CPFI command.<br><br>
            
            
                        The PEI was organized into five territorial divisions for efficient performance with each division headed by
                        a commissioner who reported to the commander of the PEI. The PEI thus developed into a supreme law and order
                        establishment, with even officials and agents of organizations such as Customs having to inform it about
                        violations that came to their notice. Not only did the PEI have powers to conduct search and seizure
                        operations, it could also frame proceedings for prosecution and file cases for extraditing
                        criminals.<br><br>
            
            
            
                        Punishment and rewards were used to enhance efficiency of the police force. Punishment included verbal
                        admonishment, censure, fines, detention upto 130 days and imprisonment for upto 30 days, reversion,
                        compulsory retirement and dismissal. If the punishment was stiff, the rewards were generous: exemption from
                        service upto 12 days, leave with salary upto 30 days and pecuniary benefits upto 30 days' pay.<br><br>
            
            
                        The strength of the PEI continued to grow year after year, keeping in mind the rising need of maintaining
                        law and order in a enlarging society. But the main reason for the growth in strength was the Portuguese
                        regime's need to contain the increasing surge of freedom movement in Goa. Much of the PEI's time would be
                        consumed in trying to contain agitations and other forms of freedom movement, that received a boost by Dr
                        Ram Manohar Lohia's civil disobedience movement launched in 1946 – the very same year of PEI's
                        establishment. In time to come, the PEI, which had gained respect for efficient policing of the territory,
                        began to court notoriety for its brutal repression of the freedom movement.</p><br><br>
