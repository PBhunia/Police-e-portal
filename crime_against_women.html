                    <h2>DOWRY HARASSMENT</h2>

                   <h3> What is dowry?</h3>

                    <P>Dowry' means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or
                    indirectly<br>
                    (a) by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage; or <br>(b) by the parents of either
                    party to a marriage or by any other person, to either party to the marriage or to any other person;
                    at or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of said parties but does
                    not include dower or mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) applies.
                    ***Explanation II.-The expression 'valuable security has the same meaning as in Sec. 30 of the
                    Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).</P>
                     <h3>What is dowry harassment? Who can complain ?</h3> 
                    <P> Dowry harassment is a
                    criminal offence in India. Dowry harassment covers a span of behaviors and actions by the man or his
                    parents or other relatives. These are <br>• The giving or taking of dowry <br>• Demanding dowry<br> Which are
                    offences under the Dowry prohibition act? Apart from these, there are offences related to dowry,
                    like cruelty under criminal law (Sec.498A IPC) which are,<br> • Any willful conduct which is of such a
                    nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide
                    or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health whether mental or physical of the woman;
                    or<br> Harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person
                    related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on
                    account of failure by her or any person related to her meet such demand. <br>The victim of dowry
                    harassment, victim's parents or victim's relatives can also make a complaint for any of the above
                    offences at the police stations.</P>
                     <h2>Dowry and Law</h2>
                    <h4>Dowry Act</h4>
                    <P>The Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961 says that any person who gives, takes, or abets the giving or
                    taking of dowry shall be punished with imprisonment, which may extend to six months or with fine up
                    to Rs. 5,000 or with both. When an FIR (First Information Report) under IPC section 498A (anti-dowry
                    law) is registered by a woman, the accused - the husband and his old parents, brothers, sisters,
                    relatives - are arrested and jailed without investigation.</P><br>
                    <h3>What is a "matrimonial home" ?</h3>
                   <h4> What rights do women have in their matrimonial home?</h4>
                    <P>The matrimonial home is the household a woman shares with her husband; whether it is rented,
                    officially provided, or owned by the husband or his relatives whether or not she has any legal title
                    in the household<br>
                    A woman has the right to remain in the matrimonial home along with her husband as long as she is
                    married, though there is no definite law regarding this right. If a woman is being pressurized to
                    leave the matrimonial home, she can ask the Court for an injunction or "restraining order"
                    protecting her from being thrown out. This can usually be obtained quite easily<br>
                    It is generally advisable not to leave the matrimonial home; it is easier to get a court order
                    preventing a woman being thrown out than to get an order enforcing her right to return to it once
                    she has left or been thrown out.</P>
